    <h1>Roleplay</h1>
<p>Role-playing or roleplaying is the changing of one's behaviour to assume a role, either unconsciously to fill a social role, or consciously to act out an adopted role.</p>
<p>PJ Masks Save The Day Admin knows that roleplay related to the PJ Masks by the PJ Masks fans existed so we have created a new section in our site specially for this. A place for everyone to upload or read roleplay by PJ Masks fans.</p>
<p>If you have a completed roleplay, you could submit your roleplay to us so it could be uploaded into PJ Masks Save The Day website. We will review each and ALL roleplay in a case-by-case basis to ensure it follow our community guidelines. You could upload via the Google Form <a href="https://forms.gle/bbCzR2gtWhv3zqzD9">here</a>.
